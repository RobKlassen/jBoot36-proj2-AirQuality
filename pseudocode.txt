=============================
The user selects a city/state_or_province/country and gets air quality information back in a visually useful way.
=============================

1.
The user is asked what city / province_or_state / country they want air quality information for

2.
The user puts in a query
    
    they select a location 
        city
        country
        province/state
    
    Using a form of selector
        dropdown menu
        radio buttons
        search bar
    
    hits submit 
        or potentially checks their selection automatically
        or confirms comparison after all their selections are made

3.
After user makes query, access the api and get the data about that city / province / country
    
    put the users information into the api query so it can find and produce the results they're looking for

    take that information and cross reference it against air quality scale

    present the data in a broadly informative way, that can let the user know the air qualtiy

    produce some sort of advice or safety information for the user

4.
Allow the user to make another query, and have the process repeatable

    As a stretch goal, potentially allow them to query multiple places at once for comparison.

    potentially try and access the worst nearby areas to them, or cleanest areas near them



STRETCH GOALS:
comparing two cities
presenting the data in a colour and vibrant way
presenting weather information
getting pictures of the cities
getting pictures of the air quality somehow
allowing the user to select a position on a map and get the information about that spot specifically
